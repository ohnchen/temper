# My first real/useful project

In this project I am trying to develop an TKinter application, which shows a thermometer and increases the heat at the click of an button.

## Things it should be able to do:
- Display thermometer
- Settings
    - Add thermometers
    - Remove thermometers
- Increase the heat!
